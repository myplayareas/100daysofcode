# 100daysofcode

## 1. Day 1 to Day 10

1. Try to solve on your won first even if it takes couple of more hours.
2. Choose a programming language, for example [Python](https://www.python.org/),  in which you feel most comfortable. I know its difficult but take some time(4/5 days) for it. Its cool.
3. Stretch yourself for a few problems and then go for a hint, but always be aware of the time you are spending on a specific problem.

- Reading/Writing from/to files.
- Reading input from the console.
- Split strings.
- 2D array implementation and how to use it.
- Basics things of language such as in C/C++ handling null-terminated strings. Command line interfaces and manipulations from CSV or text files.

## 2. Day 11 to Day 20 (Data Structures and Algorithms)

Now is the most important part i.e. the Data Structures and Algorithms which technically form the basics of solving any type of problem.

All the topics also include their respective links. You can perform their execution in your own code editor. If you know these topics already, get down directly to solve their medium or hard problems, you will learn fast.

You can see good examples in [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org), more specificatly about [Data Structures](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/?ref=shm) and [Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/?ref=shm)

1. Strings
2. Arrays
3. Linked List
4. Stacks
5. Queues
6. Time and Space Complexities 
7. Trees
8. Tries
9. Graphs
10. Hashing
11. Heaps
12. Sorting and Searching

## 3. Day 21 to Day 40 (Solving Algo’s)

In these 20 days, you would be facing some of the easy problems. Practicing and then leading to perfection is the only key here.

1. Array Problems:
- Array Rotation
- Find duplicates in an array 
- Missing number in an array 
- Merge Two Sorted Arrays 
- Subarray with given sum
2. Linked List Problems :
- Rotate a linked list
- Detect Loop in a linked list
- Find a middle element in a linked list 
- Merge two sorted linked list 
- Searching in the linked list
3. Stack and Queue Problems:
- Sort values in Stack
- Implement Two Stacks using one Array
4. Tree Problems:
- Height of a Binary Tree
- Minimum value in Binary Search Tree
- kth maximum value in Binary Search Tree
5. Graph Problems:
- Implement Breadth-First Search and Depth First Search

## 4. Day 41 to Day 60(Half way Reached)

So if you have completed so far, you have already reached half way through the course and will be able to solve almost medium level questions.

1. Sample Array Problems: 
- Kadane’s algorithm
- Inversion of array
- Maximum of all subarrays of size k 
- Trapping rainwater
2. Sample Stack and Queue Problems: 
- Queue using Two Stacks
- Stack using Two Queues
- Get minimum element from the stack
3. Sample Linked List Problems:
- First non-repeating character in a stream 
- Rotate a linked list
- Remove loop in a linked list
- LRU Cache
- Clone a linked list
- Find the Intersection point of two linked lists
4. Sample Tree and Graph Problems : 
- Detect Cycle in a directed and undirected graph 
- Find the number of islands
- Word Boggle
- Implementing Dijkstra
- Check for BST
- Vertical traversal of binary tree
- Boundary traversal of binary tree
- Delete a node from BST

## 5. Day 61 to Day 75 (Almost Completed it)

Once you have got comfortable in solving the medium level problems, then it will be "Icing on Cake" for you to solve the Hard level problems.

1. Sample Hard Level Problems: 
- Sudoku problem
- Traveling salesman problem 
- Boolean parenthesization
- Find median in a stream 
- N-Queen problem

After you have reached this stage, you will be almost be ready to crack the top companies in their Technical as well as Coding Interviews

## 6. Day 76 to Day 85(System Design)

This section is usually not given much of an importance, but still to reduce the risk of not getting selected in the interview, just because you haven't read this section should not be there. Hence, go through this sections roughly and understand some basic concepts such as Load Balancing, Caching, Proxies, CAP Theorem, Sharding or Data Partitioning, etc.

1. URL Shortening Service (Tiny URL)
2. Design Uber or Lyft
3. Design Facebook or Twitter Newsfeed.

This section mostly be descriptive and you can explain these types of terms in your own language to the interviewer. The main objective of the interviewer is that if the candidate is been able to build a large or complex or not.

## 7. Day 86 to Day 92(OS and DBMS)

In this part of #100DaysOfCode you will learn the most basic and important subjects of Computer Science like Operating Systems, Database Management. Most of the people struggle to study these concepts, but this section is equally important for cracking interviews.

For time being, I have listed out some of the sections most probable likely to be asked in the interview:

1. Process and Process Management
2. Thread and Concurrency 
3. Multithreading
4. Lock
5. Process Scheduling 
6. Synchronization and Deadlock 
7. CPU Scheduling
8. ACID Properties 
9. Indexing and Scaling 
10. Distributed file system 
11. Memory management 
12. Critical section problem

I will surely list down a separate article for the coverage of OS and DBMS further and link it down here.

## 8. Day 93 to Day 100 (OOD & Cultural Fit)

After coming so far, you will have to prepare yourself for software design principles, SOLID and DRY principles, OOPS concepts, etc.

Some of Object Oriented Design concepts are:

1. Design a Movie Ticket Booking System
2. Designing Vending Machine
3. Designing an ATM , etc.

The main goal for the object oriented design is to make sure that you truly understand classes, interfaces and then transform them into comprehensible object design. This also tells the interviewer that you clearly understand the class diagrams, activity diagrams or case diagrams.

Companies always hire a candidate which is able to mold himself/herself according to the situation, atmosphere and place, who is always passionate about their product and the culture of the company.
